# YeeyLigh
Yet another library for interfacing with yeelight devices.

# Why?
Because when I tried fairly recent available libraries none of them worked. One that's being closer to work could connect to my device but it wasn't able to send any commands.

# A fair warning for those who stumbled upon this repo
I've just started this project and I cannot guarantee that I'll maintain this repo.
While I'll try to write high quality code, that doesn't mean that it'll work for you.
Approach with caution.
